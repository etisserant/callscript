CallScript is an Android application that filters NEW\_OUTGOING\_CALL intents, and pass called phone number to a script stored on sdcard rather than initiating phone call. User can prefix numbers with `**` to bypass CallScript.

Typical use case is to initiate a callback from your favorite VoIP provider. Example use case provided in the Wiki.
